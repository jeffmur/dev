## Lattice Cryptography

Lattice cryptography is proposed as a post-quantum robust method for public key encryption, especially focused on digital signatures and key exchange mechanisms (KEMs).

> Learning with Errors (LWE) Problem

Learning with Errors (LWE) is a method defined by [Regev](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/lwesurvey.pdf) (2005). Problem involves the difficulty of finding the values which solve: $$ B = A * s + e  $$ where $$A$$ and $$B$$ are known (public key). The value of $$s$$ becomes the secret values (private key) and $$e$$ are random errors.

[Public Key LWE](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/lwe2)

The "ring" comes from the modulus of a prime number. *Why prime?* <br> Prime numbers can only be divided with itself and one. Real world example: A prime number greater than 1024 bits

[Ring LWE](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/lwe_output)

Take LWE and a prime number, 13. In this matrix, $$Z$$, expression, we have a 7x4 grid of random numbers, $$A$$, a secret, $$s$$, and small noise, $e$.

$$ Z^{7*4}_{13} * Z^{7*1}_{13} + Z^{7*1}_{13} $$

This an be solved using [Guassian elimination](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GaussianElimination.html)

Learning with Errors (LWE) method with additional polynomial rings over finite fields [theory](https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/finite).

A finite field is a set of numbers with a limit/boundry/definitive size. $$ F_2 = [0,1] $$

Given an example polynomial with a degree of 4, and a prime number of 13:
$$ Z_{13}[x]/(x^4 + 1) $$

| Operation | Polynomial | Symbol
| --- | --- | --- 
|   | $$ 4 + 1x + 11x^2 + 10x^3 $$ | $$A$$
| * | $$ 6 + 9x + 11x^2 + 11x^3 $$ | $$s$$ 
| + | $$ 0 - 1x + 1x^2 + 1x^3 $$ | $$e$$
| = | $$ 10 + 5x + 10x^2 + 7x^3 $$ | $$B$$

> Ring Learning with Errors for Key Exchange (RLWE-KEX)

Purpose: Create a shared encryption key with [Ring LWE](https://asecuritysite.com/lattice/lwe_ring)

Bob and Alice agree to share:
- Set of random numbers, $$A$$
- Number of bits in polynomials, $$n$$
- Prime number, $$q$$

They independently generate:
- Error values, $$e$$
- Secret values, $$s$$

Creating `public` keys:
- Alice: $$ b_A = A * s_A + e_A $$
- Bob: $$ b_B = A * s_B + e_B $$

Creating `shared` keys:
- Alice: $$ S_A = b_B * s_A \div (x^n + 1) $$
- Bob: $$ S_B = b_A * s_B \div (x^n + 1) $$

Removing the noise (reduce into binary):

In `shared_A` each element $$ A_i $$ is converted into a binary representative $$ u_i $$

if shared $$ A_i < \frac{q}{4} $$ then $$ u_i = 0 $$ \
else if shared $$ A_i < \frac{q}{2} $$ then $$ u_i = 1 $$ \
else if shared $$ A_i < \frac{3q}{4} $$ then $$ u_i = 0 $$ \
else if shared $$ A_i < q $$ then $$ u_i = 1 $$

Resulting in a binary representation:
``=> [1, 0, ..., 1]``
