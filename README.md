## Development

To run locally, there are a few dependencies needed to build/serve locally to `localhost:4000`

I recommend Linux, MacOS, or WSL. Powershell has known limitations with jekyll.

**Install Dependencies**
- Ruby 2.7
- gem 3.1.2
- bundler 2.4.12

**Project Dependenices**
> Can be found in [Gemfile](./Gemfile)


**Serve project**
```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling
```
